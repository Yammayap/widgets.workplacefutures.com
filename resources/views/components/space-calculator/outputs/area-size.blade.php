    <h2>Area size</h2>

    <p>Based on what you've told us, similar organisations occupy anything from <strong>{{ $areaSize->tightSqFt }} sq ft</strong> / <strong>{{ $areaSize->tightSqM }} sq m</strong> to <strong>{{ $areaSize->spaciousSqFt }} sq ft</strong> / <strong>{{ $areaSize->spaciousSqM }} sq m</strong>.</p>

    <p>Typically, the things we believe you need in your office would fit into <strong>{{ $areaSize->averageSqFt }} sq ft</strong> / <strong>{{ $areaSize->averageSqM }} sq m</strong>.</p>
